Doing this 10 times narrows down the possibilities to a single number. This kind of \"Halving\" appears in many computer science applications.

In the funcyion for the tortoise, perform a \"fast plod\" when 1 <= i <= 5, a \"slip\" when 6 <= i <= 7 or a \"Slow pod\" when 8 <= i <= 10. Use a similiar technique in the function for the hare.

Occasionally, the contenders will land on the same square. In this case, the tortoise bites the hare, and your application should display <code>\"OUCH!!!!\"</code> at that position. All positions other than the \"T\", the \"H\" or the \"OUCH!!!\" should be blank.\n",

If neither animal wins, perform a loop again to simulate the next tick of the clock."
